# üåê Real-Time Text - SwiftUI Project

Welcome to the Real-Time Text SwiftUI App! This project demonstrates how to build a SwiftUI app that allows users to enter text in a text field and displays the entered text in real-time as the user types. Additionally, there is a "Effacer" (Clear) button that resets the text field.

## Project Description

The Real-Time Text SwiftUI App showcases the power of SwiftUI in handling real-time input and updating the user interface accordingly. When users type text in the provided text field, the app immediately displays the entered text above the text field. The "Effacer" (Clear) button allows users to quickly reset the text field's content if needed.
  
## What I Learned

In this project, I focused on the following aspects:

1. **SwiftUI Text Field:** I created a SwiftUI text field to enable users to input text.

2. **Real-Time Text Display:** I implemented the real-time display of the entered text, ensuring that users can see what they are typing as they type it.

3. **Handling Button Action:** I added functionality to the "Effacer" (Clear) button to reset the text field when clicked.
